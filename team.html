		<p>We traditionally practice every Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday. 
            Weekend pracitce are 12am-2pm and weekdays 9pm-11pm. These times
            allow us to have our needed time together while not interfering
            with other academic and social commitments. Times are subject to 
            change week to week based on team needs.
        </p>

		<p>All players are expected to attend atleast two out of three practices.
            Carpools are availible for practices and games. Living on North Campus
            is not a problem! Have of our games are in our home gym, the Sports Colluseum
            and half are away. Drives to away games are never over 6 hours. Finally,
            every year the team spends a weekend in Chicago during our away game at 
            Depaul University.
