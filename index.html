			We take players of all ages from freshman to Grad students. Our only requirment is that each player
            is taking a full course load while playing. Before our tryouts we also hold annual open gyms
             for a 5 dollar entry fee. these open gyms give prospective memebers the opportunity to meet the Team
            as well as enjoy some high-leveled basketball!
